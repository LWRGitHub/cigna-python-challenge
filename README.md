# **walking through how I solved it** 

I open the CSV file, get the data & store it as a list of lists. I prepare some dictionaries and variables I will use to do calculations store data. I then loop threw & collect all the data & making sure I get the min & max values. I Then proceed to calculate all the averages. After all that the data is in a nice dict called "minMaxAvg" & I write that data to a .json, .xml, .yaml & .txt file.
